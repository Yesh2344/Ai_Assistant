## Features in Detail

### Authentication

The application uses Convex Auth for user authentication, supporting:
- Email/password registration and login
- Anonymous authentication
- Session persistence
- Secure token management

### Real-time Messaging

Messages are delivered in real-time using Convex's reactive queries:
- Instant updates across all connected clients
- Message persistence
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Automatic reconnection handling

### AI Integration

The AI assistant is powered by OpenAI's GPT models:
- Contextual understanding of conversations
- Natural language processing
- Quick response generation
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Backend Functions:
   - Add new functions in the `convex/` directory
   - Update schema in `convex/schema.ts`
   - Use appropriate Convex decorators (`query`, `mutation`, `action`)

2. Frontend Components:
   - Create new components in `src/components/`
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Follow the existing component patterns

### Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Test thoroughly before deploying

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using any static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) for the frontend, while the backend is automatically handled by Convex.

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the frontend to your hosting service
3. Ensure environment variables are set in production
